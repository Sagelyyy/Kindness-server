# Kindness - A Learning Project 🚀

Check out the [Live Preview](https://do-good.netlify.app) and the [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Sagelyyy/Kindness-frontend)!

Kindness is a full-stack web application built as a personal project to enhance my skills in Postgres, Supabase, and full-stack development. The application allows users to share positive messages 📝 with each other in real time, fostering a community of kindness and positivity 💖.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Powered by Supabase, updates to the application (such as new posts) are reflected in real-time. This ensures a dynamic and interactive user experience 🔄.

- **Profanity Filter**: We want to keep our platform a safe and respectful space for all users. As such, we've implemented a profanity filter to keep conversations clean and positive 😇.

- **Fun Avatars**: Users are assigned a unique, fun avatar based on their username, adding a visual and personalized element to the platform 🎭.

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The application is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), a powerful front-end framework for building user interfaces. SvelteKit allows us to write highly efficient, imperative code that directly manipulates the DOM, while still providing the high-level abstraction that we'd expect from a client-side JavaScript framework.

- **Backend**: Our server side is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. The architecture follows a RESTful design pattern and utilizes the [Express](https://expressjs.com) framework to handle HTTP requests and routes.

- **Database**: We use [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) via [Supabase](https://supabase.io), providing a powerful, scalable relational database with real-time capabilities. Supabase adds realtime and RESTful APIs to Postgres without a single line of code.

- **Hosting**: Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for the frontend and [Railway](https://railway.app) for the backend, providing a seamless deployment experience.
